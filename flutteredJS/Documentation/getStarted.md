## Get Started with Fluttered.js



### Create a normal HTML Skeleton and leave the body empty

~~~html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8"/>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  </head>
  <body>
    
  </body>
</html>
~~~



### Reference the fluttered.js library

Create a script tag in your html head and reference the fluttered.js file(contains the entire library).

~~~html
<script src="./flutteredJS/fluttered.js"></script>
~~~



### Create a JavaScript file to write your functionality on and reference it from your HTML head

~~~html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8"/>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <script src="./flutteredJS/fluttered.js"></script>
    <script  src="./testFlut.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    
  </body>
</html>
~~~

<strong>Note:Â </strong>from now on you only need to use your .js file to create your UI



### Starting your app

Everything starts with a Scaffold. This widget will take care of building all of the child widgets. The body will take a Fluttered widget as argument.

~~~javascript
Scaffold({
  body: SomeWidget(),
});
~~~

<strong>Note:</strong> this is inside the ./testFlut.js file

### A simple example

This code will create a Text() Widget and center it into the screen

~~~javascript
Scaffold({
  body: Center({
    child: Text({
      text: 'Some text here',
    }),
  }),
});
~~~



### Testing on Mobile

The easiest way of testing your app is by making your page available in your network by using a server. A very easy and great way to do this effortlessly is by using the Live Server extension for Visual Studio Code by Ritwick Dey. This way you can connect your computer and Mobile device to the same router and access the website so that you can test your touch controls.

Always remember in order to access a server you need to understand the URL.

Example: http://myIP:portnumber

### Get computer IP

To get your computer's local IP you can use the command prompt/line and run the command ipconfig on Windows

 and ifconfig on Linux.
